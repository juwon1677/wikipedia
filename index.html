          <p>Hove War Memorial is a First World War memorial designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens and located on Grand Avenue in Hove, part of the city of Brighton and Hove, on the south coast of England. Hove was the site of one of the earliest recruiting events at the beginning of the war and later of several military hospitals. Over 600 men from the town were killed during the war. A war memorial committee was established in 1919 and Lutyens was engaged as architect. He designed a Tuscan column on a three-staged base, topped with a statue of Saint George, patron saint of England. George, cast in the studio of Sir George Frampton, holds a sword by the blade in one hand and a shield in the other. The same statue, with variations, appears on several other monuments. The base contains several dedicatory inscriptions but no names, which are instead recorded on plaques in the town's library. The memorial was unveiled on 27 February 1921 by Lord Leconfield. It is a Grade II listed building. (Full article...) Recently featured: "Smoking on My Ex Pack"1899 Kentucky gubernatorial electionRodrigues night heron ArchiveBy emailMore featured articlesAbou</p>

        <p>West Virgina is a state in the Southern or Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States. It is the 10th-smallest state by area and ranks as the 12th-least populous state, with a population of 1,793,716 residents. The state was formed in 1861, comprising a number of counties which separated from the state of Virginia after the latter had seceded from the United States. West Virginia was admitted to the Union in 1863, and was a key border state during the American Civil War. The state is noted for its mountains and rolling hills, its historically significant coal mining and logging industries, and its political and labor history. It is also a popular tourist destination. Charleston is the capital and most populous city of the state. This 1876 illustration of the Seal of West Virginia was produced by Henry Mitchell as part of a series titled The State Arms of the Union.
