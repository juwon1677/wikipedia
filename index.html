          <p>Hove War Memorial is a First World War memorial designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens and located on Grand Avenue in Hove, part of the city of Brighton and Hove, on the south coast of England. Hove was the site of one of the earliest recruiting events at the beginning of the war and later of several military hospitals. Over 600 men from the town were killed during the war. A war memorial committee was established in 1919 and Lutyens was engaged as architect. He designed a Tuscan column on a three-staged base, topped with a statue of Saint George, patron saint of England. George, cast in the studio of Sir George Frampton, holds a sword by the blade in one hand and a shield in the other. The same statue, with variations, appears on several other monuments. The base contains several dedicatory inscriptions but no names, which are instead recorded on plaques in the town's library. The memorial was unveiled on 27 February 1921 by Lord Leconfield. It is a Grade II listed building. (Full article...) Recently featured: "Smoking on My Ex Pack"1899 Kentucky gubernatorial electionRodrigues night heron ArchiveBy emailMore featured articlesAbou</p>
